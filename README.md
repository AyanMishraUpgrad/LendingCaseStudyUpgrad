## General Information

- What is the background of your project?

The case study focuses, understanding which parameters are major to detect whether a customer will default loan or not.

- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?

Granting loans to individuals deemed "risky" constitutes the primary source of financial loss, known as credit loss. This loss represents the funds lost by the lender when borrowers either fail to repay or abscond with the owed money.

The primary goal is to identify these high-risk loan applicants to minimize such loans and consequently reduce credit loss. The focus of this case study is to employ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to pinpoint these applicants.

Conducting an analysis to ascertain the key factors, or driver variables, contributing to loan defaults is essential. These variables serve as robust indicators of default, enabling the company to leverage this insight for portfolio management and risk assessment purposes.

- What is the dataset that is being used?
The Dataset used has been included with the case study.
